            I took the opportunity to use my own data for my final project for DS 4100: Data Collection Integration and Analysis. As a runner, I was curious as to whether or not I could find any patterns between my level of activity and the weather outdoors. The project was structured to focus on the full data science pipeline—collecting, cleaning, analyzing, storing, and modeling data—with an emphasis on the process rather than the results.

            By leveraging the Fitbit Web API, I was able to pull my daily step count data from my Fitbit. I then compared that to weather features such as temperature and precipitation through multiple linear regression models to analyze their relationship. The models were insufficient and lacked the statistical significance to show a correlation between the variables; however, after some transformation, the data showed a rough upwards trend in activity between January and June as the weather grew warmer.
